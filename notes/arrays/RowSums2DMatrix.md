## 🧠 Problem Statement:

Given a 2D matrix, return an array where each element represents the **sum of elements in that row**.

---

## ✅ Approach:

- Initialize an empty result array
- Loop through each row in the 2D matrix
- For each row:
    - Initialize a sum variable
    - Loop through each element in the row and add it to the sum
    - Store the sum in the result array
