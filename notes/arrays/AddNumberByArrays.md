## 🧠 Problem Statement:

Given two arrays representing two numbers, where:
- Each element is a digit
- Digits are in **reverse order** (least significant digit first)

Return the sum as an array, also in **reverse order**.

---

## ✅ Approach:

- Convert both arrays into numbers (reversing during processing)
- Add the numbers
- Extract digits of the result from least significant to most and form the result array

---

## 🧠 Learnings:

- Practiced digit-based math without built-in big number types
- Learned reverse-digit-to-number conversion logic
- Reinforced how to handle carry and digit-based logic manually
