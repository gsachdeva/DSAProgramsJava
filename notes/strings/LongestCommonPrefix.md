# Longest Common Prefix 

## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, return the **longest common prefix** among them. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.


## Dry Run Example

**Input:** `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`  
**Output:** `"fl"`

## Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the average length.
- **Space:** O(1) extra space.
